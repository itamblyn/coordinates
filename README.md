This repository contains atomistic geometries from publications that I have worked on in the past. I am posting them here so that people trying to reproduce results, or build on work that I have done in the past can do so.

The details of the relaxation, pseudopotential, etc are contained in the relevant scientific publication.

The geometries shown here should not be regarded as the "state-of-art" solution to the particular problem. They are simply what was used at the time, based on our understanding of the system at the time (i.e. in some cases new experiments / functionals have been developed or applied which give better agreement with experiment than what is shown here).
